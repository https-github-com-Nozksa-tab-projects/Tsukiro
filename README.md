Uhhh, copy game folder files and then in bodyslide just hit "batch build". This will take fucking ages since there's 2000 outfits to build.

Once ingame load the save called "LOAD ME TO START GAME" and then just press enter. There's no vanilla start here, you just pop up somewhere random in the world and go about your business.
